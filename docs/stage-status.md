# Stage status

Production completion is tracked separately from bounded foundation acceptance
in [the Stage 1–12 gap audit](stage1-12-production-gap-audit.md). No stage is
fully complete while a roadmap requirement remains open.

Authoritative development sequence: [supplied Stage 10.7–36 roadmap](master-development-roadmap.md).

## Stage 6 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The bounded SMP foundation passed the complete release matrix: warning-denying
kernel/host Clippy, all Rust host tests, 1/2/4-CPU memory/storage/network
gates, legacy PIC fallback, 4-CPU release gates, and shell/SMP smoke. See
[the Stage 6 audit](audit-stage6-2026-09-16.md).

General multicore userspace, unrestricted concurrent device/filesystem service
throughput, multi-node NUMA page-placement qualification, non-contiguous
hotplug hardware qualification, APIC-ID-above-255 hardware qualification, and
lock coverage for remaining compatibility mutexes and priority inheritance
remain explicit deferred requirements in the Stage 6 contract. CPU-domain
placement, audited Ready-state I/O service migration, and the x2APIC MSR transport are
implemented; bounded contiguous-prefix AP offline/re-online control is also
implemented; interrupt-safe scheduler, IPC, WovenGuard, teardown, and worker
locks now enforce bounded rank and nesting
checks, and VirtIO network DMA uses an allocator-reserved physically
contiguous arena; see the [NUMA/x2APIC audit](audit-stage6-numa-2026-09-16.md),
[hotplug audit](audit-stage6-hotplug-2026-09-16.md), and
[lock-order audit](audit-stage6-lock-order-2026-09-16.md) and
[DMA audit](audit-stage6-dma-2026-09-16.md).

The 2026-09-17 lock follow-up made the file-frame cache IRQ-safe, moved
fork/dup reference retention outside the process-table lock, and added
generation-tagged VFS and pipe handles to reject stale slot reuse. The VFS
read and materialization paths now release registry/open-description guards
for disk I/O and revalidate node identity, version, backing, and shared seek
position before committing results. Both VFS tables now use ranked IRQ-safe
locks. See the
[lock-order audit](audit-stage6-lock-order-2026-09-16.md). The full release
matrix and twice-cycled 2/4-CPU hotplug gates passed after these changes.
The pipe follow-up also uses scheduler-latched wakeups and rejects full waiter
tables, closing a lost-wakeup window under concurrent readers and writers.
The global heap metadata lock is now rank-50 IRQ-safe; page mapping happens
before that guard is taken during boot. Its full release and 2/4-CPU hotplug
gates passed, while heap capacity remains bounded.
The bounded device, keyboard decoder, journal, swap-state, mount-record, and
key-vault tables now use IRQ-safe locks. Keyboard input preserves the caller's
pre-lock interrupt state for early-boot polling; Stage 1-5 journal, Stage 12.3
key-vault, Stage 12.5 mount-record, and normal PS/2 shell gates passed.
The full release matrix and dedicated twice-cycled 2/4-CPU hotplug gates also
passed after the keyboard interrupt-state correction.

## Stage 10.7 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The imported recovery source is preserved in Git commit `49e789d`. That commit
records the baseline only and does not certify acceptance.

The audit corrected worker starvation, local-preemption lock safety, readiness
observation, host-exchange validation and evidence retention. The complete gate
ended with `=== STAGE 10.7 ACCEPTANCE: PASS ===` and host exit status 0.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo build` | Passed |
| Host and freestanding-kernel Clippy with `-D warnings` | Passed |
| Rust host regressions | 13 passed |
| Python host-harness regressions | 4 passed |
| Memory/scheduler/pager/IPC/security preservation | 1 CPU: 10/10; 2 CPUs: 30/30; 4 CPUs: 20/20 |
| Live DHCP/DNS/ICMP/UDP/TCP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.4 asynchronous block I/O | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.5 asynchronous file I/O | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.6 asynchronous UDP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Strengthened Stage 10.7 asynchronous TCP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |

Total: 75 QEMU boots passed in the final full chain. Each boot required debug-exit
status 33 and its required markers; network harnesses also verified host traffic.
Final build/lint/host checks also passed and are recorded under
`audit-artifacts/final-static/`. The accepted-stage commit follows the imported
baseline as a separate Git commit; use `git log --oneline` to identify it.

## Stage 10.8 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Completion ports, operation association, batch poll/wait, bounded reservations,
cancellation events, generation retirement and timeout-aware scheduler blocking
are implemented. The full gate passed with exit code 0: all 75 Stage 10.7 boots
plus completion-port boots on 1/2/4 CPUs (78 total). The latter include Ring-3
copyout retry, measured timeout, teardown, SMP producers and consumer wakeup.
Build, warning-denying host/kernel/probe Clippy, 18 Rust tests and four Python
harness tests passed. Final host tests include waiter notification and port quota.

Focused serial evidence is retained in timestamped `audit-artifacts/stage10.8-*`
directories. See [ABI contract](completion-port-abi.md) and
[audit](audit-stage10-8-2026-09-16.md).

## Stage 10.9 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Timers, deadlines, asynchronous event objects, cancellation and sleep-until
are implemented under bounded process ownership. The 1/2/4-CPU QEMU gate,
build, warning-denying Clippy and Rust regressions passed. See
[audit](audit-stage10-9-2026-09-16.md).

## Stage 10.10 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The aggregate gate validates the Stage 10.8 completion architecture together
with Stage 10.9 timers/events on 1, 2, and 4 CPUs. All six boots passed with
exit 33 and retained serial evidence. Stage 10 is closed; Stage 11 follows.

## Stage 11.1 — accepted on 2026-09-16

PID lifecycle, parent/child ownership, exit status, wait semantics, process
groups, isolated resources and teardown passed build, Clippy, host tests, and
1/2/4-CPU QEMU validation. See [audit](audit-stage11-1-2026-09-16.md).

Next: Stage 11.2 per-process threads and join/TLS semantics.

## Stage 11.2 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Generation-safe thread IDs, owner-checked join, termination status, TLS and
thread-local errno state passed build, Clippy, host tests, and 1/2/4-CPU QEMU
validation. See [audit](audit-stage11-2-2026-09-16.md).

Next: Stage 11.3 structured notifications and lifecycle events.

## Stages 11.3–11.5 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Structured notifications, the `libwoven` userspace API boundary, and hardened
ELF/W^X loader validation passed their individual 1/2/4-CPU QEMU gates,
freestanding Clippy, and host tests. See [audit](audit-stage11-3-5-2026-09-16.md).

The follow-up ASLR pass now randomizes production ELF, stack and mmap bases
with a deterministic `qemu-test` switch; see [audit](audit-aslr-2026-09-16.md).

## Stage 12.1 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The VFS 2.0 typed interface and SystemVfs adapter passed build, freestanding
Clippy, and QEMU validation on 1/2/4 CPUs. See
[audit](audit-stage12-1-2026-09-16.md).

Next: Stage 12.2 WovenFS metadata and crash-consistency design.

## Stage 13.1 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The WovenDriver manager passed device matching, binding, suspend/resume,
build, freestanding Clippy, and 1/2/4-CPU QEMU validation. See
[audit](audit-stage13-1-2026-09-16.md).

Next: Stage 13.2 production PCIe support.

## Stages 12.2–12.5 — accepted on 2026-09-16

WovenFS metadata/integrity, volume-integrity envelope boundaries, snapshots,
and storage-management inventory each passed their 1/2/4-CPU gates. See
[audit](audit-stage12-2-5-2026-09-16.md). Production AEAD now passes the
isolated 1/2/4-CPU gate with a bounded revocable key vault; see
[audit](audit-volume-crypto-2026-09-16.md). Measured key provisioning,
persistent key storage, rotation policy, and encrypted-volume mount integration
remain open before encrypted volumes are security-complete.

## Stage 7.1.5 - accepted on 2026-09-16

The scheduler/pager watchdog and termination lifecycle gate passed in full:
50 one-CPU memory runs, 100 two-CPU runs, 50 four-CPU runs, and live
DHCP/DNS/ICMP plus host-verified UDP/TCP at 1/2/4 CPUs. See
audit-stage7-1-5-timeout-2026-09-16.md for the bounded lifecycle handoff
correction and retained serial evidence.
