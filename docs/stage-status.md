# Stage status

Authoritative development sequence: [supplied Stage 10.7–36 roadmap](master-development-roadmap.md).

## Stage 10.7 — accepted on 2026-09-16

The imported recovery source is preserved in Git commit `49e789d`. That commit
records the baseline only and does not certify acceptance.

The audit corrected worker starvation, local-preemption lock safety, readiness
observation, host-exchange validation and evidence retention. The complete gate
ended with `=== STAGE 10.7 ACCEPTANCE: PASS ===` and host exit status 0.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo build` | Passed |
| Host and freestanding-kernel Clippy with `-D warnings` | Passed |
| Rust host regressions | 13 passed |
| Python host-harness regressions | 4 passed |
| Memory/scheduler/pager/IPC/security preservation | 1 CPU: 10/10; 2 CPUs: 30/30; 4 CPUs: 20/20 |
| Live DHCP/DNS/ICMP/UDP/TCP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.4 asynchronous block I/O | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.5 asynchronous file I/O | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Stage 10.6 asynchronous UDP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |
| Strengthened Stage 10.7 asynchronous TCP | 1/2/4 CPUs passed |

Total: 75 QEMU boots passed in the final full chain. Each boot required debug-exit
status 33 and its required markers; network harnesses also verified host traffic.
Final build/lint/host checks also passed and are recorded under
`audit-artifacts/final-static/`. The accepted-stage commit follows the imported
baseline as a separate Git commit; use `git log --oneline` to identify it.

## Stage 10.8 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Completion ports, operation association, batch poll/wait, bounded reservations,
cancellation events, generation retirement and timeout-aware scheduler blocking
are implemented. The full gate passed with exit code 0: all 75 Stage 10.7 boots
plus completion-port boots on 1/2/4 CPUs (78 total). The latter include Ring-3
copyout retry, measured timeout, teardown, SMP producers and consumer wakeup.
Build, warning-denying host/kernel/probe Clippy, 18 Rust tests and four Python
harness tests passed. Final host tests include waiter notification and port quota.

Focused serial evidence is retained in timestamped `audit-artifacts/stage10.8-*`
directories. See [ABI contract](completion-port-abi.md) and
[audit](audit-stage10-8-2026-09-16.md).

## Stage 10.9 — accepted on 2026-09-16

Timers, deadlines, asynchronous event objects, cancellation and sleep-until
are implemented under bounded process ownership. The 1/2/4-CPU QEMU gate,
build, warning-denying Clippy and Rust regressions passed. See
[audit](audit-stage10-9-2026-09-16.md).

Stage 10.10 runtime integration remains before Stage 10 can close; Stage 11
follows that closure.
